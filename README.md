This is a first bash at getting a projected sphere game
going in Unity3D.

The game displays the output of four cameras placed
around a revolving earth. Theoretically when played back
via a projector with the same depth of field onto a spherical
surface, we should get a projection mapped globe. Hopefully ;)
